## An overview of NLP

An overview of Natural Language Processing

Description: This assignment asked me to create a document where I summarize previous and current approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

The document can be found [here](https://github.com/KinseyMellon/CS4395-HLT/blob/main/Assignment_Files/OverviewOfNLP_ksm180006.pdf)

## Text Processing with Python

Description: This assignment asked me to read in a csv file holding empoyee data and then create a person class to hold the information from the file. There is a function to process the text which includes checking the input data using regex and asking the user to input correct data if needed. 

A document showing a short overview of this assigment can be found [here](Homework_Assignment_1_Overview.pdf)

The Python script can be found [here](https://github.com/KinseyMellon/CS4395-HLT/blob/main/Assignment_Files/HW1_ksm180006.py)

## Exploring NLTK

Description: This assignment introduced NLTK. It explores different NLTK methods such as tokens(), concordance(), count(), sent_tokenize(), PorterStemmer(), and WordNetLemmatizer.

## Guessing Game Assignment

Description: This assignment uses python and NLTK features to explore a text file and create a word guessing game.

## WordNet

Description: This assignment asked me to demonstrate basic skills using WordNet and SentiWordNet and to learn to identify collocations.

The link to the pdf can be found [here](https://github.com/KinseyMellon/CS4395-HLT/blob/main/Assignment_Files/WordNetHW-ksm180006.pdf)

## NGrams

Description: This assignment helps us to gain experience creating ngrams from text, build a language model from those ngrams, and reflect on the utility of ngram language models.

## WebCrawler

Description: This assignemnt asked us to understand the importance of corpora in NLP tasks, understand basic HTML, understand how websites work, and to create a web crawler using web scraping from Beautiful Soup.

The link to the webcrawler .py file is [here](https://github.com/KinseyMellon/CS4395-HLT/blob/main/Assignment_Files/WebCrawlerHW-ksm180006.py)

## Syntax Parsing

Description: This assignment helps us understand concepts related to syntax parsing. This includes the thre types of parses: PSG, dependency, and SRL. We also have to be able to use these syntax parsers to complete the tasks.

The final assignment is [here](https://github.com/KinseyMellon/CS4395-HLT/blob/main/Assignment_Files/SyntaxParsing-ksm180006.pdf)

## ACL Summary

Description: Select one paper from the Long Paper Proceedings of the 2021 ACL conference and write up a summary about it.

The original paper is [here](https://github.com/KinseyMellon/CS4395-HLT/blob/main/Assignment_Files/ACL_SummaryHWPaper.pdf)

The summary report is [here](https://github.com/KinseyMellon/CS4395-HLT/blob/main/Assignment_Files/ACL_Paper_Summary.docx)

## Author Attribution

Description: This assignment allowed us to gain experience with machine learning using sklearn and experiment with the NLP task author attribution.

The final assignment is [here](https://github.com/KinseyMellon/CS4395-HLT/blob/main/Assignment_Files/AuthorAttributionHW.pdf)

## Chatbot Project

Description: Create a chatbot using NLP techniques. The chatbot needs to be able to carry on a limited conversation in a specific domain using a knowledge base and be able to store user data.

The link to the chatbot files is [here](https://github.com/KinseyMellon/CS4395-HLT/tree/main/Chatbot)

## Text Classification Project

Description: Gain experience with keras, text classification, and deep learning model variations and embeddings by finding a text classification data set and training models with it.
